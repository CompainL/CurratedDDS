# CurratedDDS
## The project
CurratedDDS was my project for my Master's Thesis. The goal of this tool is to improve the access of Data Jounralists to exemples of Data Driven Stories (DDS).
For this purpose, CurratedDDS offers a taxonomy of DDS, and a dataset of 780 DDS exemples published in 6 news outlets between 2020 and 2022.

## Code
The original version ran on Google App Script (here: https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycby2R2hmMtcNrDAMPqJGNDoU1Fd0LBt0zwPzuznUaTsMXCf27Wh3ZxSJHzWwUteHr94/exec)
